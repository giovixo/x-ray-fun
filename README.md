# x-ray-fun

This is a web interface to Monte Carlo event file for a super simple X- and gamma-ray detector.

The mass model is a box of CdZnTe, or Silicon, or CsI. The source is a monoenergetic photon beam.  The results are plotted using [Plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/).

### Event files

The Monte Carlo event files in data directory are generated by the Geant4-based BoGEMMS simulation framework (Bulgarelli et al. 2012, Fioretti et al. 2014). You can download these files from [here](https://owncloud.iasfbo.inaf.it/public.php?service=files&t=eac10983b7bad86b98e466bafa73d324).
